## Analysis Components

### 1. Sentiment Analysis
- **Overall Sentiment**: Positive, negative, or neutral
- **Subjectivity Score**: How subjective vs. objective the content is
- **Emotional Intensity**: Frequency of emotionally charged language

### 2. Linguistic Markers
- **Loaded Language**: Words with strong emotional connotations
- **Subjective Markers**: Language indicating personal opinion
- **Authority Claims**: References to experts, studies, or research
- **One-sided Arguments**: Absolute statements and generalizations

### 3. Topic Analysis
- **Main Topics**: Primary themes discussed
- **Topic Diversity**: How varied the topics are
- **Political Topics**: Topics related to politics and government
- **Controversial Topics**: Potentially divisive subjects

### 4. Framing Analysis
- **Economic Framing**: Focus on economic aspects
- **Moral Framing**: Emphasis on values and ethics
- **Security Framing**: Focus on safety and protection
- **Social Framing**: Emphasis on community and society

### 5. Credibility Assessment
- **Factual Claims**: References to data and evidence
- **Opinion Markers**: Clear indicators of personal views
- **Uncertainty Markers**: Language indicating doubt or uncertainty
- **Qualifiers**: Words that limit or modify statements

## Output Format

The analyzer provides comprehensive results including:

```json

}
```

## Bias Detection Methodology

The analyzer uses a sophisticated approach that goes beyond simple keyword matching:

### 1. Contextual Analysis
- Considers the context in which words and phrases appear
- Analyzes sentence structure and relationships
- Evaluates argument coherence and logic

### 2. Multi-dimensional Scoring
- Combines multiple analysis techniques
- Weights different factors based on their significance
- Provides confidence levels for assessments

### 3. Holistic Assessment
- Looks at the overall presentation and framing
- Considers source credibility and evidence
- Evaluates balance and fairness in presentation

## Limitations

- **Language Support**: Currently optimized for English content
- **Model Dependencies**: Requires significant computational resources for full analysis
- **Context Sensitivity**: May not capture all nuances of political discourse
- **Bias in Training Data**: Models may reflect biases in their training data
