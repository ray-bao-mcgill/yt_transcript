00:04:46.840 thought of that before but seriously
00:04:48.320 it's an option so when she says I'm a
00:04:49.680 vegetarian you say okay cool that's cool
00:04:51.520 and she orders [ __ ] tofu with grass
00:04:54.520 what would you like I'd like a steak
00:04:55.800 please why are you ordering steak
00:04:56.960 because that's what I eat that's why I

00:04:59.280 to offend you but it's what I eat I'm
00:05:01.000 not going to make you change your

00:05:15.199 must train you need to do what you're
00:05:17.680 supposed to do not what you feel like
00:05:19.800 [ __ ] doing that's the difference
00:05:21.319 between a man and a [ __ ] child she
00:05:22.880 like oh well we we've never tried
00:05:24.280 matriarchies we've only tried
00:05:25.440 patriarchies blah blah blah and I said
00:05:26.800 listen [ __ ]
00:05:32.479 they have been tried the problem is it's
00:05:34.360 very very difficult to survive under a
00:05:35.600 matriarchy it's not the natural gender
00:05:37.039 roles and the matriarchies that did
00:05:38.440 exist in humanity I'm sure they existed
00:05:40.440 the reason we don't discuss them is they
00:05:41.600 never even got a chance to create any
00:05:42.720 history CU they were [ __ ] decimated
00:05:44.240 by the patriarchies what are the odds of
00:05:46.479 every single Society since the dawn of
00:05:48.120 human time all across the planet being
00:05:49.600 run by men all of them this is not an
00:05:51.600 idea that could have spread you had the
00:05:52.759 Aztec and the ma deny they didn't
00:05:54.199 [ __ ] talk every single civilization
00:05:55.919 that we can ever possibly name or
00:05:57.600 discover men were in charge talk to us

00:11:41.760 carefully cuz it's going to sound like
00:11:42.959 something stupid but this is actually

00:12:11.279 you have to do is frame it inside of
00:12:12.480 your mind and understand that all of
00:12:13.880 those problems are going to give you the
00:12:15.199 fuel the unlimited motivation you need
00:12:16.800 to become a successful and beautiful
00:12:18.720 individual if you frame it in the right
00:12:20.320 way a man who's not dangerous a man who
00:12:23.199 has no physicality it will never be seen
00:12:25.240 as successful oh I'm successful I'm rich
00:12:27.680 and I yeah but I'll I'll break your neck
00:12:30.240 look how big my hand is I'm going to
00:12:32.320 grab you by your neck and choke you till
00:12:33.920 you die I'll show you a race riot [ __ ]
00:12:37.639 then what who's successful now I'm
00:12:39.720 breathing and you're not so I'm more
00:12:41.240 successful than you why would you train
00:12:43.519 or work hard if you don't have an ego if
00:12:45.480 you don't have an ego and you're not all
00:12:47.120 about me and what I am and who I am why
00:12:49.320 would you even care people without ego
00:12:51.120 with the lazy people oh I'm fat but I
00:12:52.959 don't care I don't have a nice car I
00:12:54.519 don't care I love myself way too much to
00:12:56.320 be broke what's crazy about this is how
00:12:57.760 could you go and sit in front of a
00:12:58.720 therapist and not cross your mind that
00:13:00.519 this therapist has a [ __ ] life
00:13:01.880 anyway all these therapists are getting
00:13:03.279 divorces and cheating on their [ __ ]
00:13:04.920 wives and are just as depressed as you
00:13:06.639 so why the [ __ ] do you think they know
00:13:07.760 anything if therapists understand
00:13:09.199 psychology so well why are they not
00:13:10.519 living these perfect ideal lives well
00:13:12.360 they're not because they don't know [ __ ]
00:13:13.600 when I said this to therapist ago we
00:13:14.880 don't claim to be perfect well if you
00:13:16.199 don't claim to be perfect then what you
00:13:17.399 know doesn't mean [ __ ] if you're telling
00:13:18.760 me that your own knowledge cannot be
00:13:20.320 applied to yourself to provide yourself
00:13:21.959 with the perfect life then you cannot
00:13:23.199 provide anyone else with a perfect life
00:13:24.600 therefore who gives a [ __ ] what you
00:13:26.120 think you're an idiot you could depress
00:13:28.279 me to the depth to Earth you could put
00:13:30.240 me in a Cell by myself solary for the
00:13:32.959 rest of my life you could kill every
00:13:34.680 family member I have you Tru my arms and
00:13:36.279 legs off I still won't kill myself cuz I
00:13:38.480 refuse cuz I have a job to do no matter
00:13:40.720 what happens to me I'm going to stay
00:13:42.320 [ __ ] man that is my name he you
00:13:45.079 talk about GTA Grand Theft Auto I find
00:13:46.880 it amazing that people will sit there
00:13:48.399 and spend all their time upgrading that
00:13:50.399 character making as much money as they
00:13:52.040 can getting strong meeting important
00:13:53.920 people getting the best car they'll do
00:13:55.759 all that in a game but they won't do it
00:13:56.839 in real life I find that incredible my
00:13:58.480 life is GT I don't need to play a game
00:14:00.440 they play the games because they're
00:14:01.480 scared of loss cuz if you die in the
00:14:03.040 game you get another chance in life you
00:14:04.680 get one shot so it was about 3:00 in the
00:14:06.399 morning and I went to the food car and I
00:14:08.079 sat down and there's these two big guys
00:14:10.240 ballheads like Mafia guys units and they
00:14:12.240 walk over to me and one of them sits
00:14:13.839 here so I'm now traed I can't move the
00:14:16.120 other one sits opposite me and I
00:14:17.360 realized I still have my Rolex on so the
00:14:19.240 guy sits opposite me and goes where are
